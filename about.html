      <h2><i class="fas fa-user"></i> Personal Background</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a student of Information Systems Management at Ruppin Academic Center.
        I thrive on combining logical thinking with creativity, and I’m the kind of person who gets excited about solving
        problems and building cool things from scratch.
        I love challenging myself, asking questions, and always pushing a little further than “good enough.”

      <h2><i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> Education</h2>
      <p>
        Currently pursuing a B.A. in Business Administration with a specialization in Information Systems.
        In high school, I focused on Biology and Social Sciences, where I discovered how much I enjoy combining analytical
        skills with understanding people.
        My academic journey has taught me discipline, teamwork, and how to learn — fast.

      <h2><i class="fas fa-music"></i> Hobbies</h2>
      <p>
        I’m all about creativity. I love web design, digital art, photography, and music.
        I also enjoy cooking (especially trying out new pasta recipes), exploring new places, and capturing moments
        through my lens.
        If it lets me be curious and expressive — I’m in!

    <div class="about-box">
      <h2><i class="fas fa-heart"></i> Personal Values</h2>
      <p>
        Honesty, empathy, curiosity, and persistence.
        I believe in asking questions, staying kind, and showing up — even when things get tough.
        I’m always striving to grow, learn from others, and bring out the best in the people around me.
