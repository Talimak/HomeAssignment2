        <p>
          I’m originally from Haifa, and currently living in the student dorms at Ruppin – a change that helped me
          become more independent.<br>
          I’ve just turned 23 and I’m excited about what’s coming next.<br>
          I love learning new things, pushing myself to improve, and figuring things out in my own way.<br>
          I enjoy taking on challenges and growing step by step.

        <h2 class="about-headers">Education</h2>
        <p>
          Currently pursuing a B.A. in Business Management with a specialization in Information Systems.
          In high school, I focused on Biology and Social Sciences, where I discovered how much I enjoy combining
          analytical skills with understanding people.
          Throughout my academic journey, I’ve learned how to work under pressure, stay organized, and manage my time
          effectively.
          It also helped me develop strong teamwork and communication skills, and taught me how to adapt quickly and
          keep learning, especially when things get challenging.

        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy reading, doing reformer Pilates, and trying out new coffee spots.<br>
          I love traveling and exploring new places. On my last trip to Austria, I completely fell in love with the
          views, the vibes, and the pace of life there.

        <p>
          Honesty, empathy, curiosity, and persistence.
          I believe in asking questions, staying kind, and showing up, even when things get tough.
          I’m always striving to grow, learn from others, and bring out the best in the people around me.
